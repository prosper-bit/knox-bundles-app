# ðŸ’¾ Commit Your Files to GitHub

Yes, you're absolutely right! After uploading files to GitHub, you need to commit them. Here's how:

## Step 2.5: Commit Your Files

### If You Used "Upload Files":
1. **After dragging/uploading your 4 files** (index.html, script.js, styles.css, README.md)
2. **Scroll down** to the bottom of the upload page
3. **You'll see "Commit changes" section**
4. **Commit message**: Type something like:
   ```
   Add Knox Bundles - Professional Data Bundle App
   ```
5. **Optional description**: You can add:
   ```
   Professional Telegram Mini App with admin panel for data bundle sales
   ```
6. **Click the green "Commit changes" button**

### If You Created Files One by One:
- Each time you created a file, you should have clicked "Commit new file"
- If you haven't committed yet, you'll see uncommitted changes

## âœ… How to Check if Files are Committed

### Look for These Signs:
1. **In your repository main page**, you should see:
   - âœ… `index.html`
   - âœ… `script.js` 
   - âœ… `styles.css`
   - âœ… `README.md`

2. **Each file should show**:
   - A commit message next to it
   - A timestamp (like "2 minutes ago")

3. **Repository should show**: "4 commits" or similar (not "0 commits")

## ðŸš¨ If Files Aren't Committed Yet

### Option 1: Commit Pending Changes
1. **Look for a yellow banner** saying "You have uncommitted changes"
2. **Click "Commit changes"**
3. **Add commit message** and click "Commit"

### Option 2: Upload Again (if needed)
1. **Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"**
2. **Upload your 4 files again**
3. **Scroll down and commit**

## âœ… After Files are Committed

Once your files are committed, you should see:
- âœ… **4 files** in your repository
- âœ… **Commit history** showing your uploads
- âœ… **Green checkmarks** or commit messages next to files

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (After Committing)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Settings â†’ Pages
   - Deploy from branch: main
   - Folder: / (root)
   - Save

2. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for deployment

3. **Get your URL**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/knox-bundles/`

4. **Test in browser**

5. **Set in @BotFather**

## ðŸ“¸ What You Should See

### In Your Repository:
```
knox-bundles/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          âœ… (committed)
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           âœ… (committed)  
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          âœ… (committed)
â””â”€â”€ README.md           âœ… (committed)
```

### Commit Messages:
- "Add Knox Bundles - Professional Data Bundle App"
- Each file shows "2 minutes ago" or similar timestamp

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status Check

**Can you confirm:**
1. âœ… Do you see all 4 files in your repository?
2. âœ… Do the files show commit messages/timestamps?
3. âœ… Does your repository show commits (not "0 commits")?

**If YES to all** â†’ Continue to enable GitHub Pages
**If NO to any** â†’ Let me know what you see and I'll help you commit the files

**Once files are committed, we can enable GitHub Pages and get Knox Bundles live!** ðŸš€
